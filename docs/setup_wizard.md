# Setup Wizard

PyDjinni comes with a setup wizard that allows to bootstrap a simple project setup from a list of available templates.

When running the wizard, a new PyDjinni Library project is initialized in the current working directory.

## Return Codes

In the event of an error, the CLI tries to provide a helpful return code for further error handling in addition to the 
error message.
